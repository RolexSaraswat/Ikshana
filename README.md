# Ikshana

Ikshana is an android application, an idea aimed at aiding the blind and people associated with them like the teachers and NGOs who work for the blind.

The problem statement solved through this project is that sometimes, manually reading braille can become a tedious and hectic task it is  time-consuming for blind people and it reduces their effectiveness. Moreover, even for the people who are associated with the blind, the teachers, parents and NGOs who work for the blind they too are our app's main focus as sometimes they too have to learn the braille to assist the blind, hence Ikshana translates the 2D braille into english readable format. 

The project is cross-platform and has been implemented in three Platforms:
1. Android Application using JAVA
2. ios Application using Swift 
3. Website using flask
